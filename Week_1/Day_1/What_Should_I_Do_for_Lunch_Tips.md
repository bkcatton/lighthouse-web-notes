### Tips

- Use different operators to compare values. Launch the files using "Node XXXX.js"

- Work on code in small chunks. 

- Print inputs / outputs as you work to allow you to easily check what is happening in your code. See below for example:

```javascript
function  whatToDoForLunch (hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
